# ‚öõÔ∏è React + üñºÔ∏è Instafeed = üòÄÔ∏è
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) implementation of [Instafeed.js](http://instafeedjs.com/)

> Instafeed.js is a dead-simple way to add Instagram photos to your website. No jQuery required, just plain 'ol javascript.

No {{templating}}. Just returns the top-level object from Instagram in a React Wrapper Component.
Do with it, what you will.

## üë©‚ÄçüíªÔ∏è Install:
```shell
yarn add react-instafeed --save
```

## üîë Beta Usage Only
**Beta Note:** This is in-flux at the moment, and will not be production ready until we move to 1.0.0. This is mostly broken until further notice. Continue to use the stable `master` branch.

## üõëÔ∏è Please read:
You probably do not need this. You can make your own API Call to Instagram in either:
- componentDidMount
- getInitialProps
Then you own how this is done and are not reliant on a 3rd party of a 3rd party.

### Import
```javascript

import { instafeed } from 'react-instafeed'
```
### Render
```javascript
  instafeed({
      limit: "5",
      resolution: "standard_resolution",
      sortBy: "most-recent",
      get: "user",
      userId: `${__INSTAGRAM_USER_ID__}`, // eslint-disable-line no-undef
      clientId: `${__INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID__}`, // eslint-disable-line no-undef
      accessToken: `${__INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN__}` // eslint-disable-line no-undef
    });
  )
```

#### API
`instafeed.js` is client facing library, so your API Keys and the like kind of need to be in the code to work. If there is a more secure way of doing this, please submit an Issue / Pull Request / etc.

These are set explicitly in this example, however, in my usual build process I have been using [babel-plugin-transform-define](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/babel-plugin-transform-define).

**Before:**
```javascript

userId='userIdInstagramApiString'
clientId='clientIdInstagramApiString'
accessToken='accessTokenInstagramApiString'
```
**After:**
```javascript

userId={`${INSTAGRAM_USER_ID}`} // eslint-disable-line no-undef
clientId={`${INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID}`} // eslint-disable-line no-undef
accessToken={`${INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN}`} // eslint-disable-line no-undef
```

If you are using [react-scripts](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/react-scripts), add your keys to your `.env` file with the `REACT_APP_` precursor:

```javascript

userId={`${process.env.REACT_APP_INSTAGRAM_USER_ID}`}
clientId={`${process.env.REACT_APP_INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID}`}
accessToken={`${process.env.REACT_APP_INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN}`}
```

FYI: Technically your API Keys are not in your Repo, however, they will still absolutely be in your end build javascript.

## üôå Props
Super props to the React, Instafeed, and Instagram teams.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è "Legal"
This software is provided as-is, and all that usually lovely stuff.
